/**
 * Write a program which takes as its input an unsorted linked list of integers and deletes any duplicate values from the list without using a temporary buffer collection or any additional collection classed, such as a HashSet. Use the LinkedListNode implementation from this week's challenge.
 *
 * Example: Given a linked list 1→2→3→3→4→4, the program should output: 1→2→3→4
 *
 * Once you've implemented the algorithm, identify the time and space complexity of your solution using Big O notation.
 *
 * Bonus 1
 *
 * Implement an alternative solution, this time using a temporary storage buffer. This second solution should represent a significant improvement over the first in terms of time complexity,
 * though it will come at the cost of additional space complexity. Be sure you can identify both using Big O notation.
