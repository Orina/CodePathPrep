/**
 * Implement a simple hashtable without using any special collections classes or helpers (you can use native Java arrays). Your implementation should minimally meet the following requirements:
 *
 * Support generics for both key and value types
 * Implement the standard get, put, remove, size, clear, and isEmpty operations as defined in java.util.Map
 * Support an initial default capacity of 16 entries
 * Support dynamic allocation of additional capacity as needed
 * Bonus 1
 *
 * Implement the entire java.util.Map interface by adding support for the remaining operations:
 *
 * Implement containsKey and containsValue
 * Implement keySet, keySet, and values
 * Implement putAll
 * Hint: One standard approach to this problem would involve using two-dimensional arrays.
